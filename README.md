Small web project to manage Assetto Corsa Competizione servers, build on Django.
Allows to manage multiple configs but currently limited to one running instance.


## Development
Currently, the project consists of two apps
* cfgs: Basically an autogenerated view from ACCs custom.json, navigating through the object
* instances: Small view used to Start/Stop the ACC server 

Configure the path to your ACC server files in accservermanager/settings.py, then run the app with
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Only tested on linux so far. It's my first Django app, so don't expect nice code ;) 


## Dependencies
Requires django and django-material, e.g.
```bash
pip install django django-material
```

## Deployment
For convenience I've created a Dockerfile which uses wine to run the ACC server.
It expects the ACC server files in the current directory.

```bash
# Copy server files
cp -a PATH_TO_ACC/server .
# Create the image
docker build -t accservermanager .
# fire up a container
docker run -d --name accservermanager -p 8000:8000 -p 9231:9231/udp -p 9232:9232/tcp accservermanager
# initiate the app and create a manager user
docker exec -i -t accservermanager /bin/bash
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

When logged in you can add more users with djangos admin pages (...:8000/admin).
