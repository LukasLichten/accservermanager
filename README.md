Small web page to manage Assetto Corsa Competizione servers.
Currently quit limited and ugly, just viewing/editing one config and starting/stopping one instance.


## Development
Currently, the project consists of two apps
* cfgs: Basically an autogenerated view from ACCs custom.json, navigating through the object
* instances: Small view currently used to Start/Stop the ACC server 

Run the app with
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Dependencies
Requires django and django-materials, e.g.
```bash
pip install django django-materials
```

## Deployment
For convenience I've created a Dockerfile, easiest is to use this.
It expects the ACC server files in the current directory.

```bash
# Create the image
docker build -t accservermanager .
# fire up a container
docker run --rm -it accservermanager
# initiate the app and create a manager user
docker exec -i -t accservermanager /bin/bash
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
